        <h1 class="span-all"> Kinds of braces (orthoses) and where they fit on the body</h1>
        
        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>
          <i>A health service provider usually prescribes braces. Braces may look different from each other based on the materials used and their ability to stabilize the limb.</i>
        </p>

        
        
        <div>

          <h3>Orthosis</h3>

          <p>
            An orthopedic appliance or apparatus used to support, align, prevent or correct deformities, or to improve function of moveable parts of the body. For example, a leg brace.
          </p>

          <h3>FO - Foot orthosis</h3>

          <p>
            An insert in a shoe to address some foot alignment problems.
          </p>

          <h3>AFO - Ankle Foot Orthosis—Short leg brace</h3>

          <p>
            A brace that supports/controls the ankle and foot, helps prevent foot drop and provides side-to-side support. It may come up to just below the knee.
          </p>

          <h3>KAFO - Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis—Long leg brace</h3>

          <p>
            A brace that supports/controls the knee, ankle and foot and may come up to just below the hip.
          </p>

          <h3>HKAFO - Hip Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis</h3>

          <p>
            A brace that controls and supports the hip, knee, ankle, foot and may come up as high as the waist.
          </p>

          <h3>SMO - Supra Malleolar Orthosis</h3>

          <p>
            A brace that encompasses/supports/controls the ankle joint and part or all of the foot and just comes up above the ankle bones.
          </p>

          <h3>KO - Knee Orthosis</h3>

          <p>
            A knee brace that just goes around the knee and has no support from the foot or ankle. One type of KO is a called a knee cage. KO’s are most often used by athletes. They usually are not effective if the calf muscle is reduced in size, thus allowing the brace to slip.
          </p>

          <h3>Ankle brace</h3>

          <p>
            Either an AFO or an SMO. 
          </p>

          <h3>Knee brace</h3>

          <p>
            Either a knee cage, a KO or a KAFO.
          </p>

          <h3>RGO - Reciprocal gait orthosis </h3>

          <p>
            A brace that encompasses both hips and provides stimulation for one leg to move forward when the opposite leg is in stance phase 
          </p>

          <h3>Powered exoskeletons</h3>

          <p>
            A device that provides support on the outside of the body and uses motorized assist powered by a system of motors or hydraulics.
          </p>

        </h1>
        <div>
          <h3>Materials used</h3>

          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Plastic</li>
            <li>Leather</li>
            <li>Carbon - Black light-weight rigid graphite fibers (cloth) used in the lamination process.</li>
            <li>Poly-pro - Carbon infused plastic</li>
            <li>Fabric or Neoprene Orthosis - Orthoses fabricated of cloth fabrics or neoprene as the primary materials in the design of the device. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Uprights</h3>

          <p>
            Usually made with plastic, various metals, carbon fiber or a combination of the materials.
          </p>

          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Medial-on the inside of the leg.</li>
            <li>Lateral-on the outside of the leg.</li>
            <li>Posterior-on the back of the leg.</li>
            <li>Anterior-on the front of the leg.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Straps</h3>
          <p>
            Secure the brace to the body, have flexible closures that are usually made of Velcro, leather, and/or fabric and can have laces or buckles above or at the ankle, the knee and/or the hip.
          </p>

          <h3>Joints</h3>
          <p>
            Allow or control motion at the ankle, knee, and/or hip joints. May be on the inside of the leg or the outside or both. Some are electronically triggered; some can be set at a certain angle to move/not move; some are lockable; some are free motion.
          </p>

          <h3>Footplates</h3>
          <p>
            Support the foot inside the shoe. They are of various lengths under the foot and may help keep the brace on the limb. May be made of plastic, carbon fiber, or various metals. 
          </p>

          <h3>Power sources</h3>
          <p>
            Such as batteries (usually lithium) or hydraulic assist mechanisms—Designed to assist the wearer to move when walking.

        </h1>
        <div>
          <h3>Off the Shelf - OFS (Pre-Fabricated Orthosis</h3>
          <p>
            Fabricated for the average sized person and are usually only minimally adjustable. Can come in sizes small, medium, and large and for left or right foot.
          </p>

          <h3>Custom Fitted (Semi-Custom)</h3>
          <p>
            A premade sized device that is fit and/or modified to a patient. Semi-custom may be an off the shelf brace used as the basic structure with specific parts added that are custom made.
          </p>

          <h3>Custom Designed</h3>
          <p>
            An individually designed, crafted, and fitted brace, made specifically to meet the unique needs of an individual. A custom brace usually requires casting and fitting before the brace is manufactured.
          </p>

          <h3>Electronic</h3>
          <p>
            A custom-made brace that can include a motor, hydraulics, and other mechanical devices. Frequently use computer sensor input to assist with the wearer’s functioning.
          </p>

          <h3>Mechanical Assist</h3>
          <p>
            Uses various mechanical principles, mechanical devices and energy storing/releasing materials, such as graphite and carbon fiber, to accomplish desired functions. 
          </p>

          <h3>Stance-Control </h3>
          <p>
            Device with an adjustable brake mechanism to add stability to an orthotic knee joint.
          </p>

          <h3>Tri-planar control</h3>
          <p>
            Controls the movement of a limb in all three directions or “straightens out the leg/foot”. Sometimes this requires corrective pressures at multiple places on the foot, ankle, leg to correct this movement: 
          </p>

          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Up and down/forward (sagittal plane) – Example: the foot is in a dropped or not dropped position </li>
            <li>Side to side (coronal plane) – as in the ankle turning in or out or the knee bending in (valgus or knock-knee) or out (Varus or bow legged)</li>
            <li>Twisting toward or away from straight ahead (rotary) -- Example: foot/toes turning in (pigeon toed) or foot/toes pointing out, or the kneecap pointing inward or outward when the person is putting weight on that leg </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When orthotists say they practice “tri-planar control,” they mean they use a three-point pressure system. They may usually do this to correct a problem only at one site, not at multiple sites simultaneously. Patients are encouraged to get clarification about which sites are addressed with tri-planar control. 
          </p>

          <h3>Dynamic Response</h3>
          <p>
            A function of the leg brace that allows it to store energy and later release that energy to help “propel the wearer forward”. Part of this is also called “floor reaction” or “ground reaction” forces—this is why the main control at the knee should be in front of the leg instead of behind it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            One mechanism that makes this dynamic response possible is a carbon fiber graphite construction that allows the brace to flex (bend) when weight is applied to it and then actively recoil back to its original position when the weight is released (the foot is lifted off the ground).

          <h3>Tri-planar Control</h3>
          <p>control of movement of a limb in all three directions or “straightens out the leg/foot” – sometimes this requires corrective pressures at multiple places on the foot, ankle, leg.</p>

          <p>
            When orthotists say they practice “tri-planar control,” by which they mean they use a three-point pressure system. They may usually do this to correct a problem only at one site, not at multiple sites simultaneously. There a few systems available that control in multiple sites. Clients are encouraged to get clarification about which sites are addressed with tri-planar control. 
          </p>

          <h3>Up and down/forward (sagittal plane)</h3>
          <p>
            Example: the foot is in a dropped or not dropped position
          </p>

          <h3>Side to side (coronal plane)</h3>
          <p>
            as in the ankle turning in or out or the knee bending in (valgus or knock-knee) or out (varus or bow legged)
          </p>

          <h3>Twisting toward or away from straight ahead (rotary)</h3>
          <p>
            Example: foot/toes turning in (pigeon toed) or foot/toes pointing out, or knee cap pointing inward or outward when the person is putting weight on that leg 
          </p>

          <h3>Dynamic Response:</h3>
          <p>
             A function of the leg brace that allows it to store energy and later release that energy to help “propel forward.” Part of this is also called “floor reaction” or “ground reaction” forces—this is why the main control at the knee should be in front of the leg instead of behind it. Another mechanism that makes for dynamic response is the carbon fiber graphite construction that will allows it to flex (bend) when weight is applied to it and then actively recoil to its original position when the weight forces are released (the foot is lifted off the ground).

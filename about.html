          <h2><span class="text-primary">About</span> HGI</h2>
          <p>
            The Human Gait Institute (“HGI”) was organized April 11, 2008. It is
            a Colorado non-profit corporation. It has obtained exempt status
            under Section 501(c)(3) of the federal Internal Revenue Code. Its
            principal office is presently located in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.
          </p>

          <h2>Our <span class="text-primary">Story</span></h2>
          <p>
            When the Human Gait Institute’s founder, Dr. Marny Eulberg, a polio
            survivor, was faced with having to go into more extensive bracing,
            she wanted a more effective brace than the industry standard braces
            that are traditionally made of metal and plastic. After much
            research, she became the wearer of the Dynamic Bracing Solutions
            (DBS) orthosis. With her DBS, she experienced the increased
            functionality it provided and a significant improvement in her life
            style.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking long-term, she recognized that the principles of the DBS
            bracing system needed to endure for continued support to its users.
            This was the original impetus for the establishment of HGI. At its
            onset, HGI focused in four areas:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="list-item-number">
              Assisting in training orthotists in the DBS technology
            </li>
            <li class="list-item-number">
              Supporting users and potential users in their use of the
              technology
            </li>
            <li class="list-item-number">
              Assisting in and/or conducting research to establish the
              effectiveness of the DBS and other advanced technologies as needed
            </li>
            <li class="list-item-number">
              Providing information on grant resources and grants to those who
              need assistance in acquiring the brace.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Over time, and based on the awareness of the creation of other new
            bracing technologies and the use of new materials, as well as
            recognizing that one type of brace does not fit all, the Board of
            HGI recognized that what they have learned about wearing a DBS brace
            can be applied to in varying degrees of use to all brace wearers.
            Therefore, they changed their mission and their focus to addressing
            the issues that anyone who is considering getting a brace for the
            first time or who is getting a new brace that is different from
            their current brace could face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of their own experiences and their observations of the
            experiences of other brace wearers, HGI members have learned that
            education and support for brace wearers is minimal at best. This is
            not because there are not caring, aware orthotists in the
            profession, but primarily because of the requirements of the medical
            insurance system and, in some practices, the requirement to meet
            product quotas to ensure that the practice is profitable. We hope
            that what we provide on this web site can, in our limited way, help
            to fill that void and provide support for those who need bracing to
            improve and/or maintain their quality of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            HGI exists through volunteers’ time, talents, and out of pocket
            expense payments, and through some small training and research
            grants and gifts. It is not affiliated with and operates independent
            of Dynamic Bracing Solutions. All of the contents on this web site

              Jim Dean, a retired attorney, did not wear a leg brace until he
              was in his 60s. Since then he has tried three different types of
              braces including a conventional brace and two custom braces. His
              results have varied, but the custom braces have provided more
              assistance than the conventional brace.

              Karla Stromberger, a retired pediatric physical therapist, went
              into bracing as a mature adult. She has braces on both legs, one a
              short leg brace (AFO) and one a long leg brace (KAFO). Her “best
              braces” have allowed her to be physically active, hiking, walking
              on the beach, and playing bocce ball.

              Margaret Hinman, a retired educator, has been in and out of
              bracing since she was 11 years old. After wearing a long-leg brace
              (KAFO) for 5 years, she quit bracing for over twenty years, and
              only went back to bracing when she hurt so bad she could not walk.
              Her current “best brace” is over 10 years old and acquired after
              trying almost every conventional and custom brace she could find
              that did not work.

              Dr. Marny Eulberg, M.D. of the Mountain and Plains Post-Polio
              Clinic, wore a leg brace from ages 4 to 13 years old and had to go
              back into bracing at age 39. She initiated her own search when she
              learned that to best meet her needs, she would have to either go
              into a long-leg (KAFO) conventional brace or find a custom
              alternative that would meet her needs. After she initiated her
              search and found her “best brace,” she founded HGI and brought
              four others along to share their journeys.

              Mike Mrozowicz has never walked without a leg brace. He has always
              worn a custom brace, including trying an electronic exoskeleton
              which did not meet his needs. He has been using his current “best
              brace” for over 7 years.

              Steve Medberry D.P.T., a practicing physical therapist, wears two
              short leg braces (AFO’s) as a result of an autoimmune disorder
              that he contracted in his late teens. He is still looking for his
              “best braces.”

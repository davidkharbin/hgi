				<section id="foreword" class="training">
					<p>
						Tips and Insights for Users of DBS braces is a narrative document
						produced by The Human Gait Institute in accordance with it's Mission
						Statement, which states:
						<i
							>"The mission of the Human Gait Institute is to assist people in
							reaping the benefits of lower extremity bracing (orthotic)
							technologies."</i
						>
					</p>
					<p>In support of this mission, the Human Gait Institute seeks to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>explore innovative technologies related to bracing</li>
						<li>
							provide resources to support individuals who are considering or
							using braces
						</li>
						<li>foster education and training of wearers and professionals</li>
						<li>support related research</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The focus of the original efforts of The Human Gait Institute was to
						support wearers of Dynamic bracing Solutions orthoses (DBS). This
						support will continue.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Human Gait Institute (“HGI”) was organized April 11, 2008. It is
						a Colorado non-profit corporation. It has obtained tax exempt status
						under Section 501(c)(3) of the federal Internal Revenue Code.
					</p>
					<p>
						HGI is governed by its five Board members who have a combined 150
						years of wearing leg braces, buying over 35 different types of
						braces. The Board members have gone through the process of obtaining
						leg braces in some form over these years. They currently all use
						innovative bracing technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						The workbook is intended to be copied for personal use only. No part
						of it can be sold for profit. However, donations to HGI to help
						defray the cost of the workbook are greatly appreciated.

				<h2>Introduction to Tips and Insights Project</h2>
				<section id="intro" class="training">					
					<h3>
						About The Development Of Tips And Insights For Learning to Use DBS
						Braces:
					</h3>
					<p>
						The videos, narratives and PowerPoints are mainly developed by Human
						Gait Institute (HGI) Board members, and other interested
						contributors. Many of the ideas come from visitors to the HGI
						website (humangaitinstitute.org) or Closed Facebook page. The
						developers of this information receive no reimbursement from HGI or
						Dynamic Bracing Solutions (DBS). The initial material has been
						developed by Karla Stromberger who had polio at the age of 9, and
						who now wears Dynamic Bracing Solutions braces. Karla is a retired
						and no longer licensed physical therapist, and presents this
						material as a DBS wearer and not a PT.
					</p>
					<p>
						For optimal success it is recommended that you read the Narrative
						for each topic and then watch the video. Pause the video part way
						through to do the activity and perfect your movements. The
						PowerPoint can serve as a summary of the activity
					</p>
					<h3>What are Dynamic Bracing Solutions Braces?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							See website:
							<a href="www.dynamicbracingsolutions.net"
								>www.dynamicbracingsolutions.net</a
							>
						</li>
						<li>Short leg (AF) and long leg braces (KAFO)</li>
						<li>They are different because they have the following:</li>
						<li>Triplanar Control</li>
						<li>Dynamic Response</li>
						<li>Energy Storing and Releasing</li>
						<li>KAFO for Knee Joint Instability</li>
						<li>Measuring, casting, fitting, fabricating time</li>
						<li>Made of carbon fiber composite</li>
					</ul>
					<div><img src="/img/brace.png" alt="" id="braceimg" /></div>					
					<p>Components of DBS braces:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>AFO - 5 piece system</li>
						<li>Brace</li>
						<li>Shoe</li>
						<li>SACH heel</li>
						<li>The person’s leg</li>
						<li>Your brain - hardest one to manage!</li>
						<li>Each brace is custom made/fabricated</li>
						<li>
							Each person’s leg is analyzed, measured, and casted for their leg
							in great detail
						</li>
						<li>Analyzed in all 3 planes</li>
						<li>
							Provides control/remodeling/support in all 3 planes unlike most
							other braces
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>
						Developmental Perspective in this work:
					</h3>

					<p>
						Having worked mainly with infants and preschoolers with challenges
						for most of my career, I have a developmental focus when observing
						people moving, and/or re-learning to move after an injury or
						illness, no matter how long ago the challenge to movement occurred.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you developed different/atypical movement patterns before 4 - 5
						years of age, your brain may have never developed, and fully
						integrated, an entirely “normal/typical” neurological pattern of
						movement. No matter what the age of onset is, many of us have been
						moving atypically for 10 – 70 years! Changing from the atypical
						way/pattern to the new one may be very challenging.
					</p>
					<p>
						Development progresses in an infant starts at the head down and
						gradually moves to the feet and hands (cephalo-caudal). An infant
						works on becoming stable with head raising while on its tummy, back
						strengthens, abdominal muscles strengthen to give the baby a stable
						base. Then the shoulders and hips become stable followed later by
						the arms and legs. As the core/base is stabilizing the neck, trunk,
						arms and legs move in all directions/planes to provide a stable base
						for movement. These include side to side, rotational, and diagonal
						movements all combined together for the purpose of later allowing
						the baby to move and attain its desires. All of this is done with
						the purpose of providing a stable base for being upright. One of the
						things that we often forget is that babies get a lot of sensory
						feedback from everything they touch, hear, smell, see, and more.
						These are important pieces for babies learning about their world and
						motivating them to move. It is important to provide all of these
						experiences for a person re-learning to walk no matter what the time
						of onset of their challenge.
					</p>
					<p>
						I like to include the pre-standing components in looking at a
						person’s overall functioning and try to recognize how those may
						impact their present-day functioning. Rotation and
						alternating/reciprocal movements of the body must be considered in
						one’s present day movement patterns. Let’s jump ahead of rolling and
						crawling, and look at how infants stand and move initially:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Buttocks back</li>
						<li>Feet apart</li>
						<li>Knees flexed</li>
						<li>Hips flexed</li>
						<li>Head up</li>
						<li>Arms up a bit holding on</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It looks very similar to these babies:</p>
					<div><img src="img/babies.jpg" alt="" /></div>
					
					<p>
						And very similar to how some of us stand and move! These positions
						allow the baby to develop a stable base for future walking. Note
						that three babies are standing with a wide base. The one who is
						standing with his/her feet closer together has more weight on one
						foot than the other and is looking more to the side. Which baby has
						the highest level of development in terms of standing?
					</p>

					</div>
					<p>
						See if you can notice some of these things: Side stepping, some
						difficulty separating legs in side stepping, slight trunk rotation,
						hands up on couch, stepping onto toes, some head turning (usually
						comes first), head is down part of the time, buttocks are back,
						wobbly transitioning to the table, reaching forward and leaning
						more, nice holding on with one hand with some hip wobble, and nice
						rotation to look at mom, waving and holding trunk tight to do so.
					</p>
					<h3>Purpose of the Project</h3>
					<p>
						The project is meant to supplement and break into smaller components
						the activities your DBS orthotist trained you to do. Hopefully you
						will be able to attain your goals with greater ease. There are some
						differences in perspective from what your DBS orthotist taught you
						to do. These activities will not work for everyone for many reasons.
						They can be adapted for many people. The project is offered in 3
						parts:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Narrative of each activity which parallels the video with more
							content than the videos
						</li>
						<li>Videos of each activity</li>
						<li>
							Power Point/Keynote to parallel the narratives and the videos
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Goals in putting this project together</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Supplement the recommended activities and break them down into
							smaller components if needed
						</li>
						<li>
							Help you learn to TRUST the brace and, therefore, be able to
							move/walk more efficiently
						</li>
						<li>
							Help you do the work of retraining your brain to move differently
							than you have before, or, attempt to re-create how you moved
							before your movement challenge occurred.
						</li>
						<li>
							Help you use what already works for you and allow it to work to
							attain your highest functional level in your brace/s. This would
							allow you to move with greater efficiency and less energy
							expenditure
						</li>
						<li>
							Help you develop an awareness of how your body moves and what it
							feels like when you move more efficiently
						</li>
						<li>
							Be Safe at all times. It is very difficult to learn a new movement
							pattern if you do not feel safe
						</li>
						<li>
							Encourage you to not rush the process! It takes time to retrain
							the brain
						</li>
						<li>
							Assist you in knowing when your brain and/or your body are
							reaching point of fatigue so that you will stop at that point
						</li>

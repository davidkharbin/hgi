						<p>
							Tips and Insights for Users of DBS braces is a narrative document
							produced by The Human Gait Institute in accordance with it's
							Mission Statement, which states:
							<i
								>"The mission of the Human Gait Institute is to assist people in
								reaping the benefits of lower extremity bracing (orthotic)
								technologies."</i
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							In support of this mission, the Human Gait Institute seeks to:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>explore innovative technologies related to bracing</li>
							<li>
								provide resources to support individuals who are considering or
								using braces
							</li>
							<li>
								foster education and training of wearers and professionals
							</li>
							<li>support related research</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The focus of the original efforts of The Human Gait Institute was
							to support wearers of Dynamic bracing Solutions orthoses (DBS).
							This support will continue.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Human Gait Institute (“HGI”) was organized April 11, 2008. It
							is a Colorado non-profit corporation. It has obtained tax exempt
							status under Section 501(c)(3) of the federal Internal Revenue
							Code.
						</p>
						<p>
							HGI is governed by its five Board members who have a combined 150
							years of wearing leg braces, buying over 35 different types of
							braces. The Board members have gone through the process of
							obtaining leg braces in some form over these years. They currently
							all use innovative bracing technology.

					<h2>Introduction to Tips and Insights Project</h2>
					<div class="training">
						<h4>
							About The Development Of Tips And Insights For Learning to Use DBS
							Braces:
						</h4>
						<p>
							The videos, narratives and PowerPoints are mainly developed by
							Human Gait Institute (HGI) Board members, and other interested
							contributors. Many of the ideas come from visitors to the HGI
							website (humangaitinstitute.org) or Closed Facebook page. The
							developers of this information receive no reimbursement from HGI
							or Dynamic Bracing Solutions (DBS). The initial material has been
							developed by Karla Stromberger who had polio at the age of 9, and
							who now wears Dynamic Bracing Solutions braces. Karla is a retired
							and no longer licensed physical therapist, and presents this
							material as a DBS wearer and not a PT.
						</p>
						<p>
							For optimal success it is recommended that you read the Narrative
							for each topic and then watch the video. Pause the video part way
							through to do the activity and perfect your movements. The
							PowerPoint can serve as a summary of the activity
						</p>
						<h4>What are Dynamic Bracing Solutions Braces?</h4>
						<div><img src="/img/brace.png" alt="" id="braceimg" /></div>
						<ul>
							<li>
								See website:
								<a href="www.dynamicbracingsolutions.net"
									>www.dynamicbracingsolutions.net</a
								>
							</li>
							<li>Short leg (AF) and long leg braces (KAFO)</li>
							<li>They are different because they have the following:</li>
							<li>Triplanar Control</li>
							<li>Dynamic Response</li>
							<li>Energy Storing and Releasing</li>
							<li>KAFO for Knee Joint Instability</li>
							<li>Measuring, casting, fitting, fabricating time</li>
							<li>Made of carbon fiber composite</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Components of DBS braces:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>AFO - 5 piece system</li>
							<li>Brace</li>
							<li>Shoe</li>
							<li>SACH heel</li>
							<li>The person’s leg</li>
							<li>Your brain - hardest one to manage!</li>
							<li>Each brace is custom made/fabricated</li>
							<li>
								Each person’s leg is analyzed, measured, and casted for their
								leg in great detail
							</li>
							<li>Analyzed in all 3 planes</li>
							<li>
								Provides control/remodeling/support in all 3 planes unlike most
								other braces
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>
							Developmental Perspective in this work:
						</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Having worked mainly with infants and preschoolers with
								challenges for most of my career, I have a developmental focus
								when observing people moving, and/or re-learning to move after
								an injury or illness, no matter how long ago the challenge to
								movement occurred.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you developed different/atypical movement patterns before 4 -
								5 years of age, your brain may have never developed, and fully
								integrated, an entirely “normal/typical” neurological pattern of
								movement. No matter what the age of onset is, many of us have
								been moving atypically for 10 – 70 years! Changing from the
								atypical way/pattern to the new one may be very challenging.
							</li>
							<li>
								Development progresses in an infant starts at the head down and
								gradually moves to the feet and hands (cephalo-caudal). An
								infant works on becoming stable with head raising while on its
								tummy, back strengthens, abdominal muscles strengthen to give
								the baby a stable base. Then the shoulders and hips become
								stable followed later by the arms and legs. As the core/base is
								stabilizing the neck, trunk, arms and legs move in all
								directions/planes to provide a stable base for movement. These
								include side to side, rotational, and diagonal movements all
								combined together for the purpose of later allowing the baby to
								move and attain its desires. All of this is done with the
								purpose of providing a stable base for being upright. One of the
								things that we often forget is that babies get a lot of sensory
								feedback from everything they touch, hear, smell, see, and more.
								These are important pieces for babies learning about their world
								and motivating them to move. It is important to provide all of
								these experiences for a person re-learning to walk no matter
								what the time of onset of their challenge.
							</li>
							<li>
								I like to include the pre-standing components in looking at a
								person’s overall functioning and try to recognize how those may
								impact their present-day functioning. Rotation and
								alternating/reciprocal movements of the body must be considered
								in one’s present day movement patterns. Let’s jump ahead of
								rolling and crawling, and look at how infants stand and move
								initially:
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Buttocks back</li>
							<li>Feet apart</li>
							<li>Knees flexed</li>
							<li>Hips flexed</li>
							<li>Head up</li>
							<li>Arms up a bit holding on</li>
						</ul>
						<p>It looks very similar to these babies:</p>
						<div><img src="img/babies.jpg" alt="" /></div>

						<p>
							And very similar to how some of us stand and move! These positions
							allow the baby to develop a stable base for future walking. Note
							that three babies are standing with a wide base. The one who is
							standing with his/her feet closer together has more weight on one
							foot than the other and is looking more to the side. Which baby
							has the highest level of development in terms of standing?
						</p>
						<p>This video shows early cruising by an infant:</p>

						</div>
						<p>
							See if you can notice some of these things: Side stepping, some
							difficulty separating legs in side stepping, slight trunk
							rotation, hands up on couch, stepping onto toes, some head turning
							(usually comes first), head is down part of the time, buttocks are
							back, wobbly transitioning to the table, reaching forward and
							leaning more, nice holding on with one hand with some hip wobble,
							and nice rotation to look at mom, waving and holding trunk tight
							to do so.
						</p>
						<h4>Purpose of the Project</h4>
						<p>
							The project is meant to supplement and break into smaller
							components the activities your DBS orthotist trained you to do.
							Hopefully you will be able to attain your goals with greater ease.
							There are some differences in perspective from what your DBS
							orthotist taught you to do. These activities will not work for
							everyone for many reasons. They can be adapted for many people.
							The project is offered in 3 parts:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Narrative of each activity which parallels the video with more
								content than the videos
							</li>
							<li>Videos of each activity</li>
							<li>
								Power Point/Keynote to parallel the narratives and the videos
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Goals in putting this project together</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Supplement the recommended activities and break them down into
								smaller components if needed
							</li>
							<li>
								Help you learn to TRUST the brace and, therefore, be able to
								move/walk more efficiently
							</li>
							<li>
								Help you do the work of retraining your brain to move
								differently than you have before, or, attempt to re-create how
								you moved before your movement challenge occurred.
							</li>
							<li>
								Help you use what already works for you and allow it to work to
								attain your highest functional level in your brace/s. This would
								allow you to move with greater efficiency and less energy
								expenditure
							</li>
							<li>
								Help you develop an awareness of how your body moves and what it
								feels like when you move more efficiently
							</li>
							<li>
								Be Safe at all times. It is very difficult to learn a new
								movement pattern if you do not feel safe
							</li>
							<li>
								Encourage you to not rush the process! It takes time to retrain
								the brain
							</li>
							<li>
								Assist you in knowing when your brain and/or your body are
								reaching point of fatigue so that you will stop at that point
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Realities!</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								There are no guarantees that the information in this project
								will work for you. These activities may not ever work for some
								of you for many reasons.
							</li>
							<li>
								Each of us is VERY different. No one will ever walk like I do,
								or like anyone else in the world. Thus, NEVER compare how you
								are walking with anyone else.
							</li>
							<li>
								Asking another DBS wearer how long it took them to learn to use
								their braces is not a predictor of how you will do. We are ALL
								different!
							</li>
							<li>
								One must commit to doing the work necessary to learn to use the
								braces. Get support when needed: family member/friend,
								orthotist, physical therapist, another person
							</li>
							<li>
								There will be progress and there will be regressions. Every
								regression has a purpose of stabilizing the base in order for
								more progress to occur so that you can move forward with greater
								stability!
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Overview of learning to use DBS braces:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Change in how you move/walk requires 1000 repetitions of each
								single activity to break up old movement patterns and integrate
								new ones. You cannot do 1000 in one day – your muscles will
								fatigue – your brain fatigue. Nobody learns well when fatigued!
							</li>
							<li>
								Doing an activity your “old way” reassures your brain that it
								does not have to be retrained and that the old way is best. This
								may be the hardest part of learning to use these braces!
							</li>
							<li>
								Do Not Rush any of these activities! You want your brain to
								learn the new way of moving. There is NO QUICK FIX! That way you
								will really integrate the new pattern of movement
							</li>
							<li>
								Practice 10 -20 min 1 to 3 times per day; increase when there is
								no fatigue. FATIGUE is not your friend! If you feel fatigue the
								next day you have done too much
							</li>
							<li>
								Being tired or sick, causes you revert to old patterns. It is
								very hard to retrain your brain at those times! Just rest!
							</li>
							<li>
								COMMIT to the process! Keeping that commitment when you are
								seeing no progress, or are plateaued for a while is most
								challenging in learning to use these braces
							</li>
							<li>
								The work is yours to do. Another person cannot do the work for
								you. They can only give you guidance and support on how to do it
							</li>
							<li>Take a day off on occasion. It’s called REST</li>
							<li>
								Sit around in your braces to get the feel of them even if you
								are unable to walk in them yet
							</li>
							<li>
								Do the activities in the order presented. They are a
								developmental progression so would be best to start with Optimal
								Standing Position (OSP) and end with the Drag.
							</li>
							<li>
								YES! The activities are BORING! Let it be a meditation on your
								future walking
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Steps in the Process:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Always start in optimal standing position – (OSP)</li>
							<li>
								Head/ shoulders always in midline and make them STAY there –
								Only Hips, knees and feet move. Watch this in the mirror
							</li>
							<li>
								Start with feet farther apart gradually moving them closer
								together
							</li>
							<li>
								Hold on to counter more firmly at first, then gradually reduce
								need to hold as quality of the movements remain consistent
							</li>
							<li>
								Make smaller symmetrical movements at first progressing to wider
								movements
							</li>
							<li>Start with slow movements, progressing to faster ones</li>
							<li>
								As you hold on less the width of the movements will decrease –
								you want quality to remain consistent
							</li>
							<li>ALWAYS want SYMMETRY in all movements</li>
							<li>
								Have a friend take a video of your progress at the end of a
								given period of time (a week or two) to see how you are doing
							</li>
							<li>
								If there is a knee or hip flexion contracture/tightness, work
								with a PT prior to receiving the braces to help reduce this
								tightness
							</li>
							<li>There will be a Pre-DBS video in the future</li>
							<li>
								At the end of a week of two of doing these activities, have a
								friend take a video of you and watch it to see how you did
							</li>

					<h2>Equipment</h2>
					<div class="training">
						<h4>Suggested Items to Assist in Learning to Use DBS Braces:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Mirror – 4 – 5 feet-tall, portable, with tape vertically down
								the middle 12 inches from the top to mark midline
							</li>
							<li>
								Parallel bars – the best to use – raised at LEAST to waist
								height, OR
							</li>
							<li>
								Kitchen counter with heavy/stable chair beside you – bath
								counter if you are very short
							</li>
							<li>
								Hiking pole, once steady in parallel bars or at counter at
								height between waist and chest
								<ul>
									<li>
										Hold it farther out in front of you than with traditional
										cane
									</li>
									<li>
										This helps gain stability/balance, esp. in trunk and hips
									</li>
									<li>
										With hiking pole people use it to stabilize and are better
										able to maintain OSP.
									</li>
									<li>
										One can advance their hips and legs properly rather than
										reverting back to old way
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Forearm crutch – handle up as high as forearm cuffs allow</li>
							<li>Cane – raise up almost as high as hiking pole</li>
							<li>
								Walker – least helpful for training – but can be raised up to at
								least waist level
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>What happens when assistive devices is too low:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								When cane/walker is used at traditional height people lean
								forward and down into it.
							</li>
							<li>This makes them lose Optimal Standing Position - (OSP)</li>
							<li>Buttocks will go back</li>
							<li>Head will go forward, and maybe down</li>
							<li>Shoulders will go forward</li>
							<li>
								Knees will bend – making it difficult to advance leg and benefit
								from spring/dynamics from the braces. Knee bending might allow
								brace to not support you/ buckle your knee
							</li>
							<li>
								Family, friend, for support with feedback and cheerleading!
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Challenges to success</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Painful or post- surgical leg on which you are not bearing full
								weight
							</li>
							<li>Fear!</li>
							<li>No availability of a cheerleader!</li>
							<li>Difficulty maintaining Optimal Standing Position</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Addendum:</h4>
						<p>
							If you have a painful or post-surgical leg, then the assistive
							device needs to be at traditional lower height to take weight off
							the painful area. It is important with DBS braces to be able to
							achieve stability in trunk and hips in the Optimal Standing
							Position (OSP –see next section) in order to move one’s legs to
							get the most efficient use out of the braces.

					<h2>Optimal Standing Position</h2>
					<div class="training">
						<h4>Purpose</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Attain the best position for your body to most successfully use
								dynamics of the braces
							</li>
							<li>
								Train your body and brain that this is a comfortable position
							</li>
							<li>
								Learn to relax in this position so you can stand for long
								periods of time
							</li>
							<li>Learn that this is a place of optimal balance</li>
							<li>Offers a starting point for most activities</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Progression</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Start facing counter/parallel bars. Later move to chair, then
								move away from counter/chair
							</li>
							<li>All weight in knee cuff of brace</li>
							<li>Feet placed wide below your hips or farther apart</li>
							<li>Hips forward – way forward to almost a point of pain</li>
							<li>Weight as far back towards heels as possible</li>
							<li>Shoulders back</li>
							<li>
								Head looking at least 10 feet ahead of you – this requires motor
								planning, which is the ability to anticipate what is coming up
								next for you and how you will move around the challenge ahead
							</li>
							<li>
								What happens when buttocks goes back - head goes down, etc.
								Demo: Trying to take a step. See above
							</li>
							<li>
								Start holding this position while holding on - gradually let go.
								You will know when you have your balance in this position when
								you KNOW your knee will not collapse and you feel like you can
								relax/rest into this position
							</li>
							<li>
								Balance in this position longer and longer, and feel stable
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Challenges to success</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Knee flexion contracture (tightness)</li>
							<li>Hip flexion contracture (tightness)</li>
							<li>
								Back pain – probably from hip flexion contracture, and other
								things
							</li>
							<li>Significant scoliosis</li>
							<li>
								Your brain telling you: “It can’t be done; I will fall; my knee
								won’t hold; my body doesn’t do that; and, and, and…”
							</li>
							<li>
								These obstacles do not mean you cannot succeed. They mean your
								way of doing them may need to be adapted
							</li>
						</ul>

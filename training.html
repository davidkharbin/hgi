          Although the braces featured in the Tips and Insights are Dynamic
          Bracing Solutions (DBS) braces, the content of the narratives and
          videos is generalized for most brace wearers, particularly those
          with custom and innovative braces.

          Tips and Insights for Users of DBS braces is a narrative document
          produced by The Human Gait Institute in accordance with it's Mission
          Statement, which states:
          <i>"The mission of the Human Gait Institute is to assist people in
            reaping the benefits of lower extremity bracing (orthotic)
            technologies."</i>
        </p>
        <p class="center-text">
          In support of this mission, the Human Gait Institute seeks to:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet sometimes-center">
          <li>explore innovative technologies related to bracing</li>
          <li>
            provide resources to support individuals who are considering or
            using braces
          </li>
          <li>
            foster education and training of wearers and professionals
          </li>
          <li>support related research</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The focus of the original efforts of The Human Gait Institute was to
          support wearers of Dynamic bracing Solutions orthoses (DBS). This
          support will continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Human Gait Institute (“HGI”) was organized April 11, 2008. It is
          a Colorado non-profit corporation. It has obtained tax exempt status
          under Section 501(c)(3) of the federal Internal Revenue Code.
        </p>
        <p>
          HGI is governed by its five Board members who have a combined 150
          years of wearing leg braces, buying over 35 different types of
          braces. The Board members have gone through the process of obtaining
          leg braces in some form over these years. They currently all use
          innovative bracing technology.

        <h3>
          About The Development Of Tips And Insights For Learning to Use DBS
          Braces:
        </h3>
        <p>
          The videos, narratives and PowerPoints are mainly developed by Human
          Gait Institute (HGI) Board members, and other interested
          contributors. Many of the ideas come from visitors to the HGI
          website (humangaitinstitute.org) or Closed Facebook page. The
          developers of this information receive no reimbursement from HGI or
          Dynamic Bracing Solutions (DBS). The initial material has been
          developed by Karla Stromberger who had polio at the age of 9, and
          who now wears Dynamic Bracing Solutions braces. Karla is a retired
          and no longer licensed physical therapist, and presents this
          material as a DBS wearer and not a PT.
        </p>
        <p>
          For optimal success it is recommended that you read the Narrative
          for each topic and then watch the video. Pause the video part way
          through to do the activity and perfect your movements. The
          PowerPoint can serve as a summary of the activity
        </p>

            <li>Short leg (AF) and long leg braces (KAFO)</li>
            <li>They are different because they have the following:</li>
            <li>Triplanar Control</li>
            <li>Dynamic Response</li>
            <li>Energy Storing and Releasing</li>

        <h3>Components of DBS braces:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>AFO - 5 piece system</li>
          <li>Brace</li>
          <li>Shoe</li>
          <li>SACH heel</li>
          <li>The person’s leg</li>
          <li>Your brain - hardest one to manage!</li>
          <li>Each brace is custom made/fabricated</li>
          <li>
            Each person’s leg is analyzed, measured, and casted for their leg
            in great detail
          </li>
          <li>Analyzed in all 3 planes</li>
          <li>
            Provides control/remodeling/support in all 3 planes unlike most
            other braces
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Developmental Perspective in this work:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Having worked mainly with infants and preschoolers with challenges
          for most of my career, I have a developmental focus when observing
          people moving, and/or re-learning to move after an injury or
          illness, no matter how long ago the challenge to movement occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you developed different/atypical movement patterns before 4 - 5
          years of age, your brain may have never developed, and fully
          integrated, an entirely “normal/typical” neurological pattern of
          movement. No matter what the age of onset is, many of us have been
          moving atypically for 10 – 70 years! Changing from the atypical
          way/pattern to the new one may be very challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Development progresses in an infant starts at the head down and
          gradually moves to the feet and hands (cephalo-caudal). An infant
          works on becoming stable with head raising while on its tummy, back
          strengthens, abdominal muscles strengthen to give the baby a stable
          base. Then the shoulders and hips become stable followed later by
          the arms and legs. As the core/base is stabilizing the neck, trunk,
          arms and legs move in all directions/planes to provide a stable base
          for movement. These include side to side, rotational, and diagonal
          movements all combined together for the purpose of later allowing
          the baby to move and attain its desires. All of this is done with
          the purpose of providing a stable base for being upright. One of the
          things that we often forget is that babies get a lot of sensory
          feedback from everything they touch, hear, smell, see, and more.
          These are important pieces for babies learning about their world and
          motivating them to move. It is important to provide all of these
          experiences for a person re-learning to walk no matter what the time
          of onset of their challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to include the pre-standing components in looking at a
          person’s overall functioning and try to recognize how those may
          impact their present-day functioning. Rotation and
          alternating/reciprocal movements of the body must be considered in
          one’s present day movement patterns. Let’s jump ahead of rolling and
          crawling, and look at how infants stand and move initially:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet sometimes-center">
          <li>Buttocks back</li>
          <li>Feet apart</li>
          <li>Knees flexed</li>
          <li>Hips flexed</li>
          <li>Head up</li>
          <li>Arms up a bit holding on</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="center-text">It looks very similar to these babies:</p>
        <img src="img/babies.jpg" alt="" />

        <p>
          And very similar to how some of us stand and move! These positions
          allow the baby to develop a stable base for future walking. Note
          that three babies are standing with a wide base. The one who is
          standing with his/her feet closer together has more weight on one
          foot than the other and is looking more to the side. Which baby has
          the highest level of development in terms of standing?
        </p>
        <p>This video shows early cruising by an infant:</p>
        <div class="iframe-container">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlXzVRJDPPg" frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          See if you can notice some of these things: Side stepping, some
          difficulty separating legs in side stepping, slight trunk rotation,
          hands up on couch, stepping onto toes, some head turning (usually
          comes first), head is down part of the time, buttocks are back,
          wobbly transitioning to the table, reaching forward and leaning
          more, nice holding on with one hand with some hip wobble, and nice
          rotation to look at mom, waving and holding trunk tight to do so.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose of the Project</h3>
        <p>
          The project is meant to supplement and break into smaller components
          the activities your DBS orthotist trained you to do. Hopefully you
          will be able to attain your goals with greater ease. There are some
          differences in perspective from what your DBS orthotist taught you
          to do. These activities will not work for everyone for many reasons.
          They can be adapted for many people. The project is offered in 3
          parts:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet sometimes-center">
          <li>
            Narrative of each activity which parallels the video with more
            content than the videos
          </li>
          <li>Videos of each activity</li>
          <li>
            Power Point/Keynote to parallel the narratives and the videos
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Goals in putting this project together</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            Supplement the recommended activities and break them down into
            smaller components if needed
          </li>
          <li>
            Help you learn to TRUST the brace and, therefore, be able to
            move/walk more efficiently
          </li>
          <li>
            Help you do the work of retraining your brain to move differently
            than you have before, or, attempt to re-create how you moved
            before your movement challenge occurred.
          </li>
          <li>
            Help you use what already works for you and allow it to work to
            attain your highest functional level in your brace/s. This would
            allow you to move with greater efficiency and less energy
            expenditure
          </li>
          <li>
            Help you develop an awareness of how your body moves and what it
            feels like when you move more efficiently
          </li>
          <li>
            Be Safe at all times. It is very difficult to learn a new movement
            pattern if you do not feel safe
          </li>
          <li>
            Encourage you to not rush the process! It takes time to retrain
            the brain
          </li>
          <li>
            Assist you in knowing when your brain and/or your body are
            reaching point of fatigue so that you will stop at that point
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Realities!</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            There are no guarantees that the information in this project will
            work for you. These activities may not ever work for some of you
            for many reasons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each of us is VERY different. No one will ever walk like I do, or
            like anyone else in the world. Thus, NEVER compare how you are
            walking with anyone else.
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking another DBS wearer how long it took them to learn to use
            their braces is not a predictor of how you will do. We are ALL
            different!
          </li>
          <li>
            One must commit to doing the work necessary to learn to use the

            There will be progress and there will be regressions. Every
            regression has a purpose of stabilizing the base in order for more
            progress to occur so that you can move forward with greater
            stability!

        <h3>Overview of learning to use DBS braces:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            Change in how you move/walk requires 1000 repetitions of each
            single activity to break up old movement patterns and integrate
            new ones. You cannot do 1000 in one day – your muscles will
            fatigue – your brain fatigue. Nobody learns well when fatigued!
          </li>
          <li>
            Doing an activity your “old way” reassures your brain that it does
            not have to be retrained and that the old way is best. This may be
            the hardest part of learning to use these braces!
          </li>
          <li>
            Do Not Rush any of these activities! You want your brain to learn
            the new way of moving. There is NO QUICK FIX! That way you will
            really integrate the new pattern of movement
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice 10 -20 min 1 to 3 times per day; increase when there is
            no fatigue. FATIGUE is not your friend! If you feel fatigue the
            next day you have done too much
          </li>
          <li>
            Being tired or sick, causes you revert to old patterns. It is very
            hard to retrain your brain at those times! Just rest!
          </li>
          <li>
            COMMIT to the process! Keeping that commitment when you are seeing
            no progress, or are plateaued for a while is most challenging in
            learning to use these braces
          </li>
          <li>
            The work is yours to do. Another person cannot do the work for
            you. They can only give you guidance and support on how to do it
          </li>
          <li>Take a day off on occasion. It’s called REST</li>
          <li>
            Sit around in your braces to get the feel of them even if you are
            unable to walk in them yet
          </li>
          <li>
            Do the activities in the order presented. They are a developmental
            progression so would be best to start with Optimal Standing
            Position (OSP) and end with the Drag.
          </li>
          <li>
            YES! The activities are BORING! Let it be a meditation on your
            future walking
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps in the Process:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Always start in optimal standing position – (OSP)</li>
          <li>
            Head/ shoulders always in midline and make them STAY there –
            Only Hips, knees and feet move. Watch this in the mirror
          </li>
          <li>
            Start with feet farther apart gradually moving them closer
            together
          </li>
          <li>
            Hold on to counter more firmly at first, then gradually reduce
            need to hold as quality of the movements remain consistent
          </li>
          <li>
            Make smaller symmetrical movements at first progressing to wider
            movements
          </li>
          <li>Start with slow movements, progressing to faster ones</li>
          <li>
            As you hold on less the width of the movements will decrease –
            you want quality to remain consistent
          </li>
          <li>ALWAYS want SYMMETRY in all movements</li>
          <li>
            Have a friend take a video of your progress at the end of a
            given period of time (a week or two) to see how you are doing
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is a knee or hip flexion contracture/tightness, work
            with a PT prior to receiving the braces to help reduce this
            tightness
          </li>
          <li>There will be a Pre-DBS video in the future</li>
          <li>
            At the end of a week of two of doing these activities, have a
            friend take a video of you and watch it to see how you did
          </li>

        <h3>Suggested Items to Assist in Learning to Use DBS Braces:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            Mirror – 4 – 5 feet-tall, portable, with tape vertically down the
            middle 12 inches from the top to mark midline
          </li>
          <li>
            Parallel bars – the best to use – raised at LEAST to waist height,
            OR
          </li>
          <li>
            Kitchen counter with heavy/stable chair beside you – bath counter
            if you are very short
          </li>
          <li>
            Hiking pole, once steady in parallel bars or at counter at height
            between waist and chest:
            <p>
              Hold it farther out in front of you than with traditional cane. This helps gain stability/balance,
              especially in trunk and hips. With hiking pole people use it to stabilize and are better
              able to maintain OSP. One can advance their hips and legs properly rather than
              reverting back to old way.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Forearm crutch – handle up as high as forearm cuffs allow
          </li>
          <li>Cane – raise up almost as high as hiking pole</li>
          <li>
            Walker – least helpful for training – but can be raised up to at
            least waist level
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What happens when assistive device is too low:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            When cane/walker is used at traditional height people lean forward
            and down into it.
          </li>
          <li>This makes them lose Optimal Standing Position - (OSP)</li>
          <li>Buttocks will go back</li>
          <li>Head will go forward, and maybe down</li>
          <li>Shoulders will go forward</li>
          <li>
            Knees will bend – making it difficult to advance leg and benefit
            from spring/dynamics from the braces. Knee bending might allow
            brace to not support you/ buckle your knee
          </li>
          <li>
            Family, friend, for support with feedback and cheerleading!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges to success</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            Painful or post- surgical leg on which you are not bearing full
            weight
          </li>
          <li>Fear!</li>
          <li>No availability of a cheerleader!</li>
          <li>Difficulty maintaining Optimal Standing Position</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Addendum:</h3>
        <p>
          If you have a painful or post-surgical leg, then the assistive
          device needs to be at traditional lower height to take weight off
          the painful area. It is important with DBS braces to be able to
          achieve stability in trunk and hips in the Optimal Standing Position
          (OSP –see next section) in order to move one’s legs to get the most
          efficient use out of the braces.

          <li>
            Attain the best position for your body to most successfully use

          <li>
            Start holding this position while holding on - gradually let go.
            You will know when you have your balance in this position when you
            KNOW your knee will not collapse and you feel like you can
            relax/rest into this position

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            Develop better flexibility in hips and low back in order to move
            more smoothly and efficiently with your braces
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve balance for reaching backward and forward in rotation
          </li>
          <li>Develop relaxed rotational movements in hips/trunk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Importance of rotation movements:</h3>
        <p>
          Rotational movements at the hip/leg help us advance the leg that is
          moving while the other hip/leg is stable/weight bearing and carrying
          the weight of the body
        </p>
        <h3>What happened to limit rotation of the hips?</h3>
        <p>
          As we age, we become less flexible in back and hips. Any challenge
          to movement (weakness, injury) and/or pain, esp. involving legs and
          trunk, causes us to tighten up and protect many areas of our body,
          esp. rotation of hips and back. This can often be improved over time
          with gentle, slow practice.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Hip Rotation Progression
        </h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            Start in Optimal standing position (OSP) – feet are slightly away
            from counter; hips are leaning into the counter a bit!
          </li>
          <li>HOLD ON to the counter!</li>
          <li>
            Minimally rotate stronger hip to press against counter – hold
            briefly. You may feel a pull in the front of your hip or feel
            slight pain in your low back. That tells you to not do too many of
            these in the beginning. Let that hip relax back to Optimal
            Standing Position
          </li>
          <li>Do not move shoulders and head!</li>
          <li>
            Now rotate the other hip to counter. It is as though you are
            pushing the counter forward with that hip
          </li>
          <li>
            If you can hold on with one hand, put your other hand on your
            buttocks – you may feel your buttocks muscles (gluts) contract a
            little or a lot. You want that! When the buttocks muscle contracts
            the muscles in front of the hip are told by the brain to
            release/let go.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to hold this position longer and longer on each side. Try to
            achieve equal force on each side
          </li>
          <li>
            Do NOT get into pain. Do NOT overdo this exercise. If you have
            pain don’t push as hard and don’t hold it for as long. As you
            attain more hip rotation the time and amount of pressure will
            increase as your muscles/joints release
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, step back from the counter ½ step. Repeat the above.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintain symmetry!! Watch this in the mirror. Rotate one hip only
            as much as the other.
          </li>
          <li>Maintain OSP -optimal standing position</li>
          <li>Next, decrease amount that you are holding on</li>
          <li>
            Now hold on with only one hand facing your mirror and watch for
            symmetry and amplitude
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually you should be able to do this exercise without a
            counter, and just free standing with no hand support
          </li>
          <li>
            Do Rotations at all speeds and note reduced amplitude of your
            movements as speed increases
          </li>
          <li>Now you can go to DBS recommended Hula Hoops</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges to Success:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Scoliosis</li>
          <li>Painful hips and low back from any cause</li>
          <li>Weak hips and low back from any cause</li>

          </li>
          <li>
            These obstacles don’t mean you cannot succeed. They mean your way

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Improve balance for sideways balance loss/challenges</li>
          <li>Improve range of motion in hips and low back</li>
          <li>
            Strengthen outside and inside hip and trunk muscles areas
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Importance of side to side movements:</h3>
        <p>
          Side to side movements are important if a person is bumped from the
          side or loses balance to the side since these movements may prevent
          the person from falling to the side. These activities may help a
          person catch themselves to prevent a fall.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is there limitation in side to side movements?</h3>
        <p>
          As we age we become less flexible in back and hips. Any challenge to
          movement (weakness, injury) and/or pain, esp. involving legs and
          trunk, causes a person to tighten up and protect many areas of the
          body. Tightening up with balance loss is a protective response and a
          person usually reverts to old patterns of movement when this
          happens. It is important for people to be able to recover without
          going into an “old patterns” that might cause them to fall in their
          braces. This can often be improved over time with gentle, slow
          practice.

            Assume OSP - Optimal Standing Position facing parallel bars or
            counter - HOLD ON!
          </li>
          <li>
            Lean into counter (facing counter) feet slightly back from
            counter. Barely move hips from side to side –
          </li>
          <li>Do NOT MOVE shoulders/head</li>
          <li>
            You may feel a stretch or some pulling on the side you are moving
            toward
          </li>
          <li>SYMMETRY: Move hips an equal amount from side to side.</li>
          <li>Widen sway at counter with NO shoulder/head sway</li>
          <li>Take a small step back from the counter but HOLD ON!</li>
          <li>
            Next step: Stand between 2 chairs if they are heavy and watch
            yourself in a Mirror
          </li>
          <li>Sway hips side to side minimally and later broaden sway</li>
          <li>Be very careful to NOT FATIGUE!!</li>
          <li>
            Keep movements symmetrical!! Without moving shoulders and head –
          </li>
          <li>
            Remain in (OSP) optimal standing position. If you see your
            buttocks drop back, then you have lost OSP.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do these slowly, fast, and medium speed without letting
            shoulders/head sway or buttocks dropping back
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually hold on less and less as long as you can maintain
            symmetry
          </li>
          <li>
            Progress to not holding on. Notice that the amplitude (width of
            sway) decreases when you do this. Goal is to have the amplitude be
            the same holding on and not holding on, with no shoulder sway
          </li>
          <li>
            SWAY to one side, unweight the opposite foot a bit and HOLD for a
            few seconds without letting your hip drop. If your hip drops on
            the non-weight bearing leg side, it means the opposite hip is
            weaker. Sway slightly less to side and hold, or decrease time of
            hold to make the movements symmetrical
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stepping Side to Side:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Optimal standing position (OSP) at counter – HOLD ON!</li>
          <li>
            Step to the side with the stronger leg and don’t let your buttocks
            drop back; your hip on non-weight bearing side should NOT drop
            down!
          </li>
          <li>
            Step to the side. Make sure that your knee does not feel like it
            will give out. It shouldn't if you maintain OSP
          </li>
          <li>Go both to left and right</li>
          <li>Bring legs fully together with each step</li>
          <li>You want your legs to take equal width steps</li>
          <li>
            Take narrow steps, wide steps, fast, slow, medium steps without
            buttocks falling back or hip dropping.
          </li>
          <li>Gradually do this without holding on</li>
          <li>
            You have succeeded when you can do the grapevine/weave without
            holding on
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges to Success:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Dislocated/dislocating hip</li>
          <li>Significant weakness throughout the hip</li>
          <li>Significant muscle imbalance throughout hip</li>
          <li>
            Weakness of hip adductors – muscles that bring your legs together
          </li>
          <li>Hip flexion contractures (tightness)</li>
          <li>Hip pain, esp. from arthritis/bursitis</li>
          <li>Limitation in hip and low back movements</li>
          <li>Scoliosis impacting hip movements</li>
          <li>Difficulty maintaining OSP</li>
          <li>
            Your brain telling you: “it can’t be done!; I will fall!; My knee
            won’t hold!; And my body doesn’t do that!; And, and, and…”
          </li>
          <li>
            These obstacles do not mean you cannot succeed. They mean your way
            of doing them may need to be adapted.

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            Heel strike tells the entire leg and body to straighten – it’s a
            neurological response
          </li>
          <li>
            Heel strike triggers the dynamic response of the brace to propel
            you forward
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Typical Gait Pattern:</h3>
        <p>
          includes forward movement, side to side movements; rotational
          movements; heel strike; weight bearing; non-weight bearing; push off
          from the toes
        </p>
        <h3>Heel Strike</h3>
        <p>
          straightens the knee and activates dynamic response of brace:

      <img src="img/heel-strike-2.jpg"
        alt="A diagram with a close-up view of the 'heel strike' while wearing an AFO brace." />

      <h3>Challenges to success:</h3>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>
          Heel strike feels scary at first because you are thrown forward
        </li>
        <li>
          If you land flat footed, you will not get the spring from the brace
          and you will not walk as efficiently
        </li>
        <li>
          If your knee does not fully straighten – (knee flexion
          contracture/tightness) – you cannot get an effective heel strike.
          Must work to stretch out knee flexion contracture
        </li>
        <li>
          Increased muscle tone in either or both legs may make this movement
          difficult

        <p>
          his is an ACTIVITY/EXERCISE – NOT a way of walking! Refer to the
          prior section about Heel Strike before attempting this! This is a
          technique to teach you to activate heel strike to make your brace
          work properly. This is NOT a way to walk!
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Learn what heel strike feels like</li>
          <li>
            Learn to pull your leg forward with your hip rather than hip
            flexors
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn what it feels like to have the brace throw you forward
          </li>
          <li>Learn to integrate heel strike into walking pattern</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Drag</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            MIRROR: You would benefit from doing this activity in front of a
            mirror so that you can judge whether you are doing it correctly
          </li>
          <li>HOLD ON to a counter with your side to the counter</li>
          <li>
            Start by standing on your more involved (weaker) leg under you and
            your stronger leg back – looks like you are taking a step
          </li>
          <li>ROTATE the HIP of your stronger leg forward.</li>
          <li>
            Let your toe of the back shoe DRAG forward as the HIP rotates
            forward
          </li>
          <li>
            This should give your stronger leg the momentum to swing the leg
            forward and land on your stronger leg (heel) HARD!
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t take a step! Just want get used to the feel of landing HARD
            on your stronger heel (NOT flat foot) – If you are on a kitchen
            floor you should hear contact with the floor. It is difficult for
            your knee to collapse when you do this correctly if there is no
            knee flexion contracture!
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat/Practice many times with your stronger leg! You need to
            learn what it FEELS like to do this activity so that you can later
            better judge whether you are doing it correctly with your weaker
            leg.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you do not rotate the hip enough, and do not drag the toe you
            will not do it right. You do not need to use your hip flexor
            muscles to do this motion. Watch the video carefully.
          </li>
          <li>
            SWITCH LEGS: Now put the less strong leg/hip back and do this same
            activity with your weaker leg back. It should look like what you
            did with your other leg. Watch this in the mirror and the video.
          </li>
          <li>
            This activity can also be done as diagonals that your DBS
            Orthotist recommends. And the important thing is that you get that
            hip only rotated forward first
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Taking a Step</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            This activity can also be done as diagonals that your DBS
            Orthotist recommends. And the important thing is that you get that
            hip only rotated forward first
          </li>
          <li>Then move stronger leg back and weaker one forward</li>
          <li>HOLD ON to counter!</li>
          <li>
            Rotate hip forward and let it pull your leg forward (no toe drag)
            so that you have heel strike. Keep the movement going as you move
            your other foot
          </li>
          <li>
            Getting thrown forward: You may feel like you are getting thrown
            forward when you start taking steps. This is expected and normal.
            That is why these are DYNAMIC Braces! Do NOT do this until you can
            do it correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep practicing. If after a few steps on each leg you are
            advancing your leg with your hip flexor, STOP! Go back and either
            rest or start over!
          </li>
          <li>NO FATIGUE please!</li>

        <h3>Challenges to Success:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>
            Knee flexion contracture (your knee doesn’t straighten all of the
            way)- you will not be able to do the Drag until the contracture is
            stretched out. Get help!
          </li>
          <li>
            Hip flexion contracture (tightness) - you might be able to do the
            Drag with less efficiency without stretching it out
          </li>
          <li>
            Plantar Flexion contracture (foot and toes pointing downwards at
            all times) – With a knee flexion contracture, and with the heel of
            the shoe built up sufficiently, one might be able to get heel
            strike
          </li>
          <li>Lack of hip rotation</li>
          <li>
            Hip abduction contracture (leg is stuck out to the side)

          <li>
            Every time you change shoes go back and do your activities

          <li>
            Hula hoops does not mean using a real Hula Hoop – it means
            wide rotational movements
          </li>
          <li>
            Trunk Control is very important - will improve with some of these
            activities
          </li>
          <li>

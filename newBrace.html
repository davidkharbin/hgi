        <h1 class="span-all"> Some Hints for Being Successful with a New Brace</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Any leg bracing system has three components: the leg, ankle and/or foot of the wearer, the brace itself and the shoes that you wear. The better they work together, the better you will walk.</li>
          <li>The ideal shoe to wear with a brace fits closely around the brace and the foot, holding you snugly and comfortably within it, and has a sole that sets flat on the ground, including around the edges, in order to provide maximum stability when standing and walking. </li>
          <li>Newly acquired braces, no matter how perfectly they are made, may need some modification starting immediately. Don’t leave the orthotist’s office without getting it tweaked and comfortable and, go back as often as necessary to make sure the brace fits correctly.</li>
          <li>Braces should not hurt and should not chafe the skin. Work with the orthotist as soon as and as frequently as needed to make the modifications necessary to prevent and/or alleviate the problem.</li>
          <li>Wearing a new brace changes how your body works. Generally, most people require time and practice to get comfortable wearing it. Get used to it gradually, starting out wearing it an hour or two at a time and then increasing the time over a few days or weeks until it becomes a comfortable part of your daily life. Often, prescribed exercises from the orthotist and/or a physical therapist when you get the brace can help the learning process. </li>
          <li>A physical therapist can often help with the transition to a new brace, providing insights and practices that they can see and guide you through in order to stand and walk better. </li>
          <li>Every pair of shoes is different, and people usually adjust to those differences without any thought. Brace wearers can be more sensitive to the subtle differences and may need to “break in the shoes” every time they get new ones or change to a different pair. This may require doing the old prescribed exercises and practice to regain and improve stability.</li>
          <li>The body and the braces change over time and the brace may need to be modified throughout its life, so keep your orthotist’s phone number handy!</li>

        <h1 class="span-all">Factors to Consider When Making the Decision to Get a New or Custom Brace</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>
          Getting a custom leg brace involves time, commitment and money! The first consideration is:
        </p>

        <div>

          <h3>Are you physically able to use the brace you want?</h3>

          <p>
            The first step is to make an appointment with your local orthotist, to see what options might be available for you. Also, refer to the workbook, Exploring Leg Brace Options on this website. If you do not know of or are unable to locate an orthotist in your area, the American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics, www.ABCOP.org, a national organization for orthotists has a list of certified orthotists in your area. At that time, you can then get an idea as to what the range of the cost would be, and then you will be able to proceed to the next steps in making your decision.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also take into consideration other health conditions and factors that might affect your ability to use a brace.
          </p>

          <p>
            After determining eligibility, you may want to consider the following factors:
          </p>

          <h3>Emotional readiness</h3>
            <p>If you haven’t worn a brace at all or haven’t worn one on a daily basis, are you ready to commit to the reality of wearing a brace? Have you come to some acceptance of using this piece of equipment? If you already are wearing a conventional brace, are you ready to commit to wearing a brace that may be unlike any other brace you have used and may require unlearning years of compensatory movement? </p>

          <h3>What is your ability to commit the time necessary to learning to use the brace? </h3>
            <p>Successful leg brace wearers have had to commit time every day for months and sometimes, even years to retrain the muscles to work well in some braces. </p>

          <h3>What is your ability to persevere and to tolerate frustration?</h3>
            <p> Learning to walk in a different brace effectively and efficiently may require multiple repetitive cycles of correct foot, knee, hip and trunk motions. If you 1) have given up easily and/or become bored quickly in other learning situations, 2) have limited ability to deal with frustration or 3) feel you cannot develop the tolerance for the frustration that will occur, you might want to consider your ability to succeed in learning to use a new brace that requires significant learning and practice. </p>

            <ul class="bullet">
              <li>Perseverance—New leg brace users may need to be able to persevere over time and in spite of frustrations until they are able to “get it.” Then they are happy that they persevered. </li>
              <li>Frustration—The training regimen for a new brace is a very personal journey. Critical to becoming successful in a new brace, particularly a custom brace, should include continued on-going support and feedback from health care professions such as the orthotist and a physical therapist if you want it. Be prepared for times when you can become frustrated at your apparent lack of progress or accomplishment. If you doubt your tolerance for frustration and feel you cannot develop the tolerance needed, or if you do not have the ability to deal with that frustration, you may be tempted to give up too soon on learning to use your brace. The orthotist, physical therapist, and family may be helpful in encouraging you through the rough spots.</li>
            </ul>


          <h3>Are you worth it?</h3>
            <p>Custom brace wearers have had to balance the cost of the brace with how they value themselves and the potential for an improved life style. Those that finally make the decision in favor of that brace have said, “I am worth the cost and the work!”</p>

          <h3>What is your support system?</h3>
            <p>Are family or friends or other important persons in your life supportive of your choice? Although getting the brace and using it are ultimately personal choices, the people close to you can affect positively or negatively your ability to proceed with its use. It is helpful to have people on your side.</p>

          <h3>Recognize that you may come up against unexpected emotions as you proceed with wearing the brace.</h3>
            <p>Wearers have talked about having to deal with unexpected memories and experiences such as forgotten feelings related to original hospitalizations and treatments. </p>

          <h3>Priorities and costs—Getting a custom brace involves real money, even if insurance will pay for part of it.</h3>
            <p>Wearers have had to put priorities on where their money goes. Is it to a custom brace, a new car, a college education, taking money out of retirement funds, a child’s wedding, or from another purpose? Some brace wearers have chosen to take out loans, or apply for grants from charitable groups as ways to finance their brace. </p>


          <h3>There may be additional costs that need to be factored into your budget, depending on the resources you have at hand. </h3>
            <p>Transportation costs and lodging costs may be necessary if you are in a remote location from a specific brace facility. Also, many wearers have found it helpful to have a set of parallel bars or handrails in a hallway, a full-length mirror, and some sort of video capability either with a camera phone, a digital camera with a movie mode, a video camera or a web cam to use for getting instant feedback. Other costs could include multiple visits to the orthotist, physical therapists and other therapists, and/or some brace modifications. Some of these costs (including mileage and other transportation costs) may be deductible from income taxes; your tax advisor should be consulted. </p>

          <h3>A part of the preparation for getting a new brace is researching insurance options. </h3>
            <p>Some insurance policies allow for getting durable medical equipment from outside of their network, some do not. Some insurance policies will pay more for a brace than others. Some custom brace wearers have chosen to change insurance policies for the year that they bought the brace, sometimes paying more money for premiums for that year in order to be better compensated for their purchase. The important factor is whether the increased premium costs are outweighed by the reimbursement from the insurance company. </p>

            <p>Another factor to check out is if the company your orthotist works for has a contract with your particular insurance company that prohibits them from collecting additional money from you except for the established co-pay/deductible.</p>

        <h1 class="span-all">Expectations and Reality</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>Hearing something is complicated. Often, we will hear something and automatically change it, ignore it or believe it. We will attempt to fast track learning skills. What someone is told and what they hear as it relates to them are often two different things. Or, what they are told, and how they believe it will work in their case, are two different issues. </p>

        <p>People with long-term neuromuscular conditions who have overcome so many obstacles in life often underestimate the time required to rewire the brain. It is not just knowhow. It also requires endless good practice cycles in order for the brain to stimulate nerve endings so they start connecting, and it takes time to develop muscle memory and time to maintain that muscle memory. Add into the mix that the learner is fighting all previous known safety movement strategies that have gotten one through life. It is a part of human nature to follow the well-known safe path. Even when people are told this, they have no idea of how strong those internal safety mechanisms truly are and what it will take to conquer them. </p>

        <p>Cognitively, everyone will understand what needs to be done, and they may say to themselves, “Well it doesn’t look too hard. I’ll show them.” One must understand that learning to use certain custom braces is not a race or contest! The person who masters the techniques will soon catch up and far surpass the others who try to take shortcuts. </p>
      </article>

      <article id="">
        <h1 class="span-all">About Learning </h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>Part of a comprehensive bracing system may include training and feedback during the learning process, and some people may not have to learn at all. Ideally if you need training, you should not just be given your brace and then be sent home to figure out by yourself how to walk correctly in the brace. When shopping for a new brace from an orthotist ask whether training and feedback are part of the cost of the brace and get a list of resources to help with the learning process. The experience of many long-term brace wearers is that they have never had anyone take time to teach them how to walk correctly. </p>

        <p>Often, a custom bracing system is different because the ability to walk successfully in it takes learning new skills and many hours of practice in order to feel comfortable and competent in using it. </p>

        <p>The technical term for what has to happen in learning to use the brace, in addition to teaching the muscles and the body to move correctly, is neural programming. Essentially, neural programming is the action of creating pathways in the muscles, spine, and also the brain that, through practice tell the body how to move. Persons with long-term disabilities involving walking have “forgotten” or never learned how to walk correctly and have developed compensatory methods of getting from point A to point B. These may not work with your new brace or are excessively inefficient and fatiguing. So, through the exercises and practice, the brain pathways are retrained and the body learns to walk differently.</p>

        <p>This is often the source of frustration for the new custom brace wearer, as many of us feel that we have the skills, and maybe some of us do, to learn quickly to walk in the brace. For those of us whose reality is different from our expectations, this is how learning works: </p>
      </article>

      <article id="">
        <h1 class="span-all">How Learning Works</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>First of all, every time we do something, we are establishing or reinforcing neural pathways in the central nervous system. If we do it wrong, our body and brain will record the wrong way it was done and the action will be reinforced every time it is repeated. Then, to do the motion correctly, we will have to unlearn that action by establishing and practicing the correct actions. This then takes more time. Therefore, it behooves us to “do it right” as we are learning and practicing. Easier said than done, but it is a goal to work toward. </p>

        <p>Another factor in learning that has been in play for some brace wearers is that we have no standard against which to judge if we are moving correctly. If we have no memory of how it was to walk correctly, then we cannot “know” when we are doing it right. This again can be frustrating because we may think we are doing it right, and then get feedback either from the orthotist or the physical therapist that tells us we need to go back to practicing basic exercises. </p>

        <p>For many of us, this learning process means that we will have to break down exercises into smaller parts, learning little bits of the motion, before we can do the complete motions. This is where a physical therapist can be of value, in that he or she can assess the actions, and help break down the steps and help put them together for greater success. That person can also give us sensory feedback that helps us learn to feel the new way of moving. </p>

        <p>Another frustration that happens with the learning process is that often we seem to be making little or no progress, or going backwards, or standing still in our learning to use the new brace. According to developmental learning specialists, a person goes through a series of expansions, i.e., making progress and moving forward, and plateaus, i.e., consolidating what has been learned. Knowing this is how people learn, and accepting this as normal, can help reduce the frustration and possible discouragement that can come after months of practice without any apparent progress.</p>

        <p>Another factor in learning that is talked about in education is the topic of learning styles. Proponents of learning styles state that if a person knows his or her learning style and then can tailor his or her learning to fit with that style, they will learn better and more quickly. Some experts question whether there is such a thing as learning style and also question how many styles there are. Discussion aside, if you know that you learn better by seeing something done than by hearing how it is done, then try to use that in your training. This is where a mirror comes in handy for some, while repeating out loud the motions as you do them might make the learning easier for others. Another modality is the tactile one, where you have to touch or feel to learn. Perhaps the most effective way to learn is to use all of the modalities, seeing, hearing, touching, moving and feeling. </p>

        <p>In the long run, it is not so important that you know the name of your learning style, as it is to be able to find the manner and the tools that will help you learn how to walk correctly in your brace. Ultimately, when you can feel that you are doing it right and have feedback that tells you that you are doing it correctly and safely, you will then be able to move on to the next step in becoming proficient in your brace. By the way, it is also a sign of progress when you can feel (catch yourself) doing it wrong and can correct it. </p>

      <article id="">
        <h1 class="span-all">Trust</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>Trust comes with time and practice. And, it may not even be an issue for some brace wearers, however if it becomes an issue, it cannot be willed to happen nor hurried or rushed!! Trusting enough to walk comfortably and correctly in the new brace involves two factors:</p>



        <div>

          <h3>1. Trusting the brace itself</h3>

          <p> If you are wearing a traditional brace or no brace at all and you change to a custom brace, the physical changes that were built into the brace to correct any deformities and the dynamic response component, if they are is part of the brace, can make you unsure about whether the brace will be stable enough to keep you from falling.</p>

          <p>Another factor in trusting the brace involves putting full body weight on the brace. This may be something that you may not have done in your previous brace or if you were walking without a brace and “favoring” a disabled limb. </p>

          <p>The exercises related to learning to walk in a specific brace will help with trust in using the brace.</p>

        </div>

        <div>

          <h3>2. Trusting yourself </h3>

          <p>This trust may be harder to achieve, because learning to use the new brace may go contrary to everything you have learned previously in order to keep yourself safe.</p>

          <p>The mistrust may start the first time you put the new brace on and your center of gravity changes, causing a perceived instability because you no longer have the tried and true means of standing that you have used for years. The mistrust also manifests itself in the fact that many of us watch our feet as we walk, not trusting that we can look farther ahead and not lose our footing and fall down. By holding our heads up and looking farther ahead, a practice that helps with balance when using a brace, your body learns to trust that it can anticipate potential pitfalls and can compensate for them, thus keeping you safe. </p>

          <p>Overcoming the mistrust may mean identifying those fears, facing them and then putting security and protection into the learning process. Parallel bars are one of the tools that contribute to safety while learning to use the brace. Constant practice and being successful in walking will reduce the fear and increase the trust. </p>

          <p>There can be, however, a deeper trust issue that manifests itself, and that is that our bodies have been trained to walk a certain way to compensate for our disability and the physical habits that have been successful in protecting us need to be unlearned. These behaviors may be so ingrained that we are not cognitively aware that we are doing them. And, unlearning them may be our biggest challenge. Again, practice and feedback from a gait expert will help you become aware of the compensatory patterns that you have. Then, as you practice, you can get the feeling of the correct way to walk, and ultimately your body will “trust” that it is doing it right. </p>

        </div>
      </article>

      <article id="">
        <h1 class="span-all">Communication</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>Keeping in communication with your orthotist is part of the support system that makes wearing a new brace successful. Wearing it and learning it is a dynamic process. This means that as you progress, it is helpful to get feedback from the orthotist. Also, as you wear the brace, your leg(s) and your gait may change, which may mean that the brace needs to be modified over time in order for you to walk comfortably and competently.</p>

        <p> Your orthotist can also tell you if what is happening with the brace is normal or needs some intervention to fix a problem. </p>

        <p>In other words, your orthotist should continue to be involved in your progress after you get your brace. However, you must be the one to initiate the communication. You have only you to keep track of your progress while the orthotist has many clients. At the same time, the orthotist should be willing and happy to hear from you and will be responsive to your needs. You should not feel reluctant to contact him/her.</p>

        <p>Other support persons with whom you can keep in the communication loop are your referring physician and your physical therapist. These people can also give you feedback and advice that will keep you safe and healthy.</p>
